                <p class="card-text">
                  The manhwa "Solo Leveling," created by the artist Chugong (추공), tells the story of a decade ago when a “Gate” connecting the real world to the world of monsters opened. Ordinary people began gaining the power to hunt
                  monsters inside the Gate, becoming known as “Hunters.” However, not all Hunters are strong. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, a Rank-E Hunter. I am someone who risks my life in the lowest-level dungeons, known as the “Weakest in
                  the World.” Lacking any notable skills, I barely earn enough money by fighting in low-level dungeons… at least until I discover a hidden dungeon with the most difficult challenges in a Rank-D dungeon! In the end, as I
                  faced death, I suddenly gained a strange power: a quest log visible only to me, and the secret to leveling up known only to me! If I train according to my quests and hunt monsters, my level will rise. From being the
                  weakest Hunter, I will become the strongest S-rank Hunter!

                  Sung Jin-Woo is the main protagonist of "Solo Leveling." Initially, he is introduced as a Rank-E Hunter, the lowest and weakest rank in the world of hunters. Despite his status, Jin-Woo is known for his dedication and
                  perseverance, often putting his life on the line in dangerous dungeons just to make ends meet. His skills are minimal, and he struggles with low-paying dungeon quests, making him appear as the weakest hunter among his
                  peers.However, Jin-Woo's life changes dramatically when he encounters a hidden dungeon with the most difficult challenges. On the brink of death, he receives a unique power that grants him a quest log visible only to him
                  and a secret method to level up. With this newfound ability, Jin-Woo starts to rapidly increase his strength and skills, transforming from the weakest hunter into the strongest S-rank Hunter. His journey is one of
                  incredible growth and redemption as he rises to become a legendary figure in the world of hunters.
