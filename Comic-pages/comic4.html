                <p class="card-text">
                  Strange monsters known as "kaiju," similar to Godzilla, have appeared in Japan for years. To combat these ferocious creatures, an elite military unit known as the Defense Corps risks their lives every day to protect
                  civilians. After a kaiju is defeated, "cleaners" working under the Professional Kaiju Cleanup Company are left to dispose of the remains.Kafka Hibino, a 32-year-old member of the Professional Kaiju Cleanup Corp, is also a
                  childhood friend of Mina Ashiro. They had both vowed to join the Defense Forces together and protect Japan from kaiju. However, Kafka repeatedly failed the entrance exams and eventually gave up on his dream of becoming a
                  Defense Force member, while Mina went on to become the captain of Division 3 of the Defense Forces.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Kafka Hibino is the protagonist of Kaiju No. 8. At 32 years old, he works as a cleaner for the Professional Kaiju Cleanup Corp, a job he took after failing repeatedly to join the Defense Forces, a prestigious military unit
                  dedicated to fighting kaiju. Despite his failures and current role, Kafka harbors a deep desire to protect Japan from these monstrous threats. His life takes an unexpected turn when he gains the abilities of a kaiju
                  himself, leading him to navigate the challenges of his new identity while still holding on to his dream of defending the country alongside his childhood friend, Mina Ashiro, who has become a high-ranking officer in the
                  Defense Forces.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Mina Ashiro is Kafka Hibino's childhood friend and a key character in Kaiju No. 8. Unlike Kafka, Mina successfully joined the Defense Forces and has risen to the rank of Captain in Division 3. Driven by her determination
                  and skills, she plays a crucial role in defending Japan from kaiju attacks. Mina and Kafka had once vowed to join the Defense Forces together, but their paths diverged when Kafka failed the entrance exams. Despite their
                  separation, Mina's achievements and Kafka's new abilities as a kaiju both influence the evolving dynamics between them as the story unfolds.
